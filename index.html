<h2>What have you won?</h2>
<p>You have won the markets, best phone, 10/10 on every tech reviews. <br><br> The iPhone X is the only model to featu
re what Apple has dubbed a "Super Retina" display. At 458 pixels-per-inch (ppi),this screen has the highest pixel
density ever seen in an iP hone. It dwarfs the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which clock in at 326 ppi and 401 ppi 
respectively. <br<br>>While the iPhone X is smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus, its edge-to-edge display is the biggest of
the three, measuring 5.8 inches diagonally to the 8's 4.7 inches and 8 Plus' 5.5 inches. <br> <br> The iPhone X also uniquely
features an OLED display, a lighting technology that produces a superiorly vivid and realistic feature. This gives the
iPhone X's screen a 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio, while the 8 Plus has only 1,300 to 1. <br><br>Finally, the iPhone X's
display supports HDR (high-dynamic range), meaning the movies and videos you watch will be hugely superior in quality
o those on the iPhone 8. In short, the screen is kind of a big deal. It looks better than any other in a phone.
